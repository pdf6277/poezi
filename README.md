--->I was born in the city of Fier.
My poetic creativity is sanctioned in the books published over the years, about 15 books of poetry, prose and philosophical expressions.
This adds to the natural lawfulness of human life, rebirth and other spiritual births, which have only dated the beginning, and the end can not be prophesied by anyone. Their longevity does not know and has nothing to do with the aging process of aging, on the contrary, this process can rejuvenate and refresh in the untimely time, depending on the values ​​and tastes of future readers.
Here is how the poet friends express themselves for more:
-Poet Brunilda Boçova, I read the renaissance and birth biography, with the first beginning in 1998.
Why do I say rebirth and birth?
In my opinion, the poet is reborn through creativity and at the same time the continuity of his soul is born with his most special, most beloved, most tangible and sensitive creatures, the books. As rebirth occurs and is felt within the poet's self in the magical moments of creation, birth comes out of the self materialized with the published book.
-Let me, without going into the details of the literary analysis of Brunilda's prosperous creativity, make a journey of symbolism, precisely the renaissance and birth time of her creativity.
-The first birth is the first dilemma, the first thought, worry and worry, as well as the first joy, emotion and happiness.
In Brunilda, this multitude of feelings and thoughts, concentrates on the baptismal title itself, a title that constitutes the sanctioning of creativity in her first book.
Thus begins the poet's first birth journey, who asks us and asks herself, convinced that more than us, she is the decoder of the solution code of the question, "How to write the sigh".
-Brunilda warns the reader about her position in the world view, stable position, unchanging, but enriched through different and varied points of view.
To me, this positioning resembles the axis, the center of gravity, which according to the impact intensity multiplies in the ripples.
After asking and asking how to write the sigh, the poet overcomes the situation in 1998, preferring another birth journey in, "Dream Waterfall", which she manages to touch and bring to life after five years (2003).
-Completed in touching realities inside and beyond the real, the poet adds her claims to the boundless space of the universe, so much so that in the same year (2003), even "Discs begin to speak" through the cosmic pen.
-He received a CERTIFICATE from the Municipality of Fier, distinguished as a young talent for 2004 and since this year is a Member of the League of Writers and Artists of Albania.
